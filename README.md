# eShop - E-commerce Application ðŸ›’

## Overview
eShop is a scalable and secure back-end system designed for an E-commerce platform. Built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**, this project focuses on delivering robust features such as category management, route validation, professional error handling, and API documentation.

The system is currently under active development, with upcoming features including **JWT-based authentication**, product and order management, and advanced business logic.

This project showcases my skills in backend development, RESTful API design, and database management while adhering to best practices in software engineering.
